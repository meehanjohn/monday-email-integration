# monday-email-integration

A program to automate tracking of customer web-queries using monday.com.

The user drags incoming web request emails into a designated folder, which
will be scanned intermittently. Emails are parsed for relevant information,
which is then used to create new board items on [Monday](monday.com) using
their GraphQL API.
